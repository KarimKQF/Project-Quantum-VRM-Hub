## 🚀 MISSION CONTROL
**QUANTUM VRM HUB** is a next-generation volatility research platform and financial dashboard. It integrates real-time market visualization, advanced genetic algorithms for Sharpe Ratio maximization, and a cyberpunk-inspired interface for the modern quantitative analyst.

### 🧠 CORE MODULES

#### 1. 🧬 GENETIC SHARPE OPTIMIZER
*Located in `/quant_research`*
A high-performance **GPU-accelerated** mining engine finding the "God Portfolio".
- **Torch-Powered**: Massively parallel portfolio optimization on NVIDIA RTX GPUs.
- **Genetic Evolution**: Survival of the fittest algorithms to hunt for Sharpe Ratios > 10.
- **Turbo Mode**: Initializes with 50,000 random portfolios for instant convergence.
- **Hall of Fame**: Tracks legendary portfolios in `HALL_OF_FAME.csv`.

#### 2. 🔮 VRM DASHBOARD
*Located in `/VRM`*
The visual heart of the project.
- **3D Volatility Surfaces**: Interactive rendering of market volatility.
- **Glitched UI**: A reactive, "Matrix-style" interface responding to user interactions.
- **Team Nexus**: Anonymous, icon-based team roster with interactive particle effects.

#### 3. 📊 PROJECT CF
*Located in `/project-cf`*
The computational finance suite.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Path-dependent pricing engines.
- **GARCH Modeling**: Stochastic volatility forecasting.
- **Technical Analysis**: Real-time RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
